 * active days together and hides every quiet one — the shape of a month with
 * four busy days would be indistinguishable from a month that was busy
 * throughout.
 *
 * A day with no reading stays null and a measured zero stays zero. They look
 * the same on a bar chart and mean opposite things: one is silence from the
 * source, the other is a day this person did none of it.
