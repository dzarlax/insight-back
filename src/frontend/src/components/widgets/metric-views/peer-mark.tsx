/**
 * How far from the middle of the pool one reading sits, on an axis every
 * metric shares.
 *
 * A list of numbers each followed by its median asks the reader to do the
 * subtraction nineteen times, and a per-metric bar asks them to learn a new
 * scale on every row. Measuring the distance in cohort spreads instead —
 * `(value − median) / IQR` — puts hours, messages and percentages on one axis,
 * because "eight tenths of a spread below the middle" means the same thing
 * whatever is being counted.
 *
 * The point of the shared axis is the vertical line it makes — drawn once by
 * the list behind every mark (`PEER_MARK_CENTRE`), not per row, because a line
 * broken by row padding is just a column of dashes and the effect dies.
 * Everything ordinary settles onto that line. The blending is deliberate: "I
 * am like the others here" is the answer that should cost no attention, and
 * what the eye is left with is the few marks standing off it.
 *
 * Lower on the left, higher on the right — never flipped by direction.
 * Orienting the axis so that "left" means "worse" would smuggle a verdict into
 * the geometry, and for a metric with no better direction there is no worse to
 * point at.
 *
 * Colour is the one place a verdict is allowed, and only at its narrowest.
 * Standing out is not the same as being wrong: eleven spreads above the middle
 * is remarkable on any metric and a problem on almost none. So a mark is grey
 * unless the shared standing calls this reading bottom-of-pack on a metric
 * that HAS a wrong direction — the same call the overview makes, in a dot
 * instead of a red card. Two coloured marks in a list of nineteen is a
 * finding; nineteen coloured marks is a scoreboard, and the reader did not ask
 * to be scored on every row.
